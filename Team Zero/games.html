	<h2>The Glade - Currently In Development</h2>
	
		<h4>Overview</h4>
			<p>
				The Glade is a semi-open-world game with rogue-like elements. The world you inhabit is filled with various monsters, looming villians, and trapped heros whom you will interact with during your ascension. You will utilize powerful melee weapons and as you ascend, these weapons will provide
				different benefits that will aid you throughout the game. Fight through hordes of enemies to free these trapped hero's, realize your past, and unite at the summit of The Glade.
			</p>
		<h4>Story</h4>
			<p>
				You wake up in the Citadel, the lowest island suspended in The Glade. With no recollection of how you got here, you gather your bearings and exit the area. Upon exiting, you glance up and see an array of floating islands that make up The Glade.
				As the player, you must guide Wren to ascend The Glade through rifts connecting the islands to recover your memories bit by bit. However this will be no easy task as there are mysterious forces at work,
				watching you and hindering your progress. Ascend and receive clarity or fall into madness as you repeat this ascension for eternity.
			</p>

	<div class="card-desc">
		We took inspiration from the level design of Risk of Rain 2. In that game, 
		the player is given limited freedom to explore each area, encounter enemies, and 
		collect stat boosting items. Now imagine these levels with more freedom for exploration 
		and methods of traveling between play spaces.

	<div class="card-desc">
		The story of Hades is extraordinary and unique. The story is unfolded through the players failure to
		reach the surface. The Glade's story will be building on this template with other unique ways of 
		portraying its story.

	<div class="card-desc">
		Player progression is one of the pillars that made Call Of Duty's Zombies Mode such a powerful experience.
		The futility of your situation and that feeling of overcoming those odds, now being able to destroy anything in 
		your path, is one of the mode's greatest strengths. The Glade will mimic this pillar and take it to a whole new level.

<p>
	The Glade will experiment with the ideas from these games, mix them together, and create a completely new and unique
	gameplay formula.

        <p>
            I am David Hanzl, a student who is a new Front End Developer in this industry.
            My passion is creating unique & palatable websites for others to use.
            I am always determined to learn new methods and features for developing websites and would be a 
            great addition to your team.

        <p>Html - CSS - JavaScript - JQuery</p>
        <p>
            My knowledge of the languages listed is above average but my passion for
            this work is incredible. Specializing in Front End Development, creating stylish and easy to use
            websites are my goal. However I also have a solid understanding of Asp.Net, Java, and SQL 
            that would make me the perfect position for positions focusing on other aspects of Web Development.

            Life is busy, and our brains can only retain so much information as day to day tasks
            continue to pile up. Introducing my site <em>Get It Done</em>, a basic To-Do List site which
            can lighten your mental load and display your day to day tasks and goals for you to tackle.

        <p>
            On the side I am learning other softwares outside of coding, like Blender & Unity,
            which got me thinking - If I was a succesful Indie Game Developer, what would my website look like.
